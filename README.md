# University Assignments Repository

Hello and welcome to my repository of university assignments!

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my academic journey in the field of computer science and related courses during my time at university. The assignments housed here range from my earlier days as a budding developer to the more recent times as I honed my skills.

## Overview

- **Coursework**: The repository encompasses a wide range of courses, from foundational computer science topics to more advanced and specialized areas.
  
- **Skill Evolution**: The code in this repository reflects my growth and evolution as a developer. Some of the earlier assignments might not represent my current abilities. For a closer look at my recent projects and current skill level, I recommend checking out my [Gomoku-AI project](https://github.com/wuzikang961215/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Gomoku-AI).

- **Languages & Tools**: Assignments here have been developed using a variety of languages and tools, reflecting the diverse curriculum of my academic program.


## Notes to Recruiters and Enthusiasts

If you're a recruiter or a tech enthusiast looking to understand my capabilities, I'd suggest starting with my more recent personal projects. The assignments in this repository, especially the earlier ones, were part of my learning process and might not be indicative of my current expertise.

Thank you for stopping by and exploring my academic journey. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss any of the projects in further detail!
